What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: Git marks that directory w/ a '.git' file so it has a means by which to "know" to track it.
Without the .git file, there would nowhere for git to put its meta data and begin tracking files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: The staging area offers an intermediary from the working directory and the respository.
The working area thus can have files added to it w/o affecting the staging area.
The repository though has not been altered yet while the user determines which files s/he'd liked tracked.
One value would be that a user could continue to add files to the working directory w/o altering the potential commit.
