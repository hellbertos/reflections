When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: I think the biggest benefits would be the two described in the lesson: when working from  adifferent computer (e.g. home vs work comp, borrowing a friend's comp if you were out of town or your comp was broken).
Also, when working on a larger project with more than one other person.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: The remote respository may be updated by other people so it would be important to vet what changes were made to make sure there wasn't conflict with your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: I would use a fork when I want my own copy of a repository which I don't have permission to change
I would clone to copy a repository down from GitHub to my local computer
I woud create a branch when I wanted to make changes/additions to my project on my local machine without changing the core files of the project.
